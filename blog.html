			<h2> <center>Challenges</center> </h2>

				<p> 
					The challenges I had on this assignment I'd say mostly 
					are due to problems non-class related. For example I was
					having problems connecting to the ENGR server on anything
					except VS Code. It took me awhile but I eventually took care
					of the problems I was having. 
				</p>

			<h2> <center>What was learned?</center></h2>

				<p>
					So far my experience of all Web Dev was an HTML elective 
					I took in 7th grade for a semester. So for what I learned,
					it has basically been everything. I remember somethings
					like opening and closing things like head, body, and h1 
					along with other things. But for the most part it has 
					been mostly all learning.
				</p>

			<h2><center>Resources</center></h2>

				<p>
					In terms of resources that I used for this assignment I 
					used three main sources. The first source was classmates,
					I had contacted these classmates though the discord we had 
					made (I'm sorry, I know we are supposed to use campuswire 
					but I am just a lot more used to discord, and I am more 
					comfortable with its UI as well). The second source of help
					was lecture recordings. Lecture recordings were a big help
					throughout almost all of issues I was having, it helped with
					many different aspects of the assignment. The third and 
					final source I used was of course the internet. Just like 
					with the videos from lecture I used this throughout my 
					entire assignment.

					I learned a lot of different things from this assignment. 
					One of which was building my css skills which I thought were
					good but it seems that I was wrong with that assumption. One 
					thing that was helpful though was being able to work will fellow 
					students to help get through the assignment. There are still many things
					I need to improve on in terms of css. I also used the class webpage
					on campuswire while doing the assignment to help with getting some of 
					my questions answered. Something that was really helpful in the completion
					of my assignment was going back and looking at lecture recordings. They
					are always so helpful.

			<h2><center>What is this language even?</center></h2>

				<p>
				
					One thing that truly was a problem for this assignment was learning how JavaScript 
					stores data in memory. There were multiple times where I had to figure out how it was
					needed to be written in order for it to work. This was really only problematic because
					I feel we haven't really gone over memory storage of data in class yet for JavaScript.
					I feel like this assignment though really helped with my foundation of JavaScript, and 
					has also really gotten me excited for personal projects that I want to do that would use
					JavaScript. It was also really useful to get help from my classmates. More specifically my 
					group mates for the final project.

				<p>
					
					This assignment was over all not to bad if I am being completely honest. It was a little harder
					than it probably should have been because I did not make it to the last lecture because I was 
					not feeling to go from the vaccine. But one thing that was helpful was being able to and looking
					over the recorded lecture, which has been proven to be very helpful in more than just this assignment.
					I learned a lot from this assignment because I really had to build my  foundation on server side JS.
					Not only that but I had some problems setting up certain things pertaining to nodejs which helped me 
					learn some things.

			<h2><center>Its the end of the term as we know it</center></h2>

			<p>

				This assignment for me was actually rather easy. I know for a lot of my groupmates for the final project
				found this assignment rather challenging, but for some reason this has probably clicked better than most
				things that we have done in this class. With that being said I did not really use much help from anything 
				to complete this assignment. All I really used was the recorded lectures and besides that I was mostly helping
				people with their code. This was also helpful because I feel that I am even better at this then when I first 
				completed the assignment. All and all I truly loved this class and wish I could take more of it.
