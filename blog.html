			<h2> Challenges </h2>

				<p> 
					The challenges I had on this assignment I'd say mostly 
					are due to problems non-class related. For example I was
					having problems connecting to the ENGR server on anything
					except VS Code. It took me awhile but I eventually took care
					of the problems I was having. 
				</p>

			<h2> What was learned? </h2>

				<p>
					So far my experience of all Web Dev was an HTML elective 
					I took in 7th grade for a semester. So for what I learned,
					it has basically been everything. I remember somethings
					like opening and closing things like head, body, and h1 
					along with other things. But for the most part it has 
					been mostly all learning.

			<h2> Resources </h2>

				<p>
					In terms of resources that I used for this assignment I 
					used three main sources. The first source was classmates,
					I had contacted these classmates though the discord we had 
					made (I'm sorry, I know we are supposed to use campuswire 
					but I am just a lot more used to discord, and I am more 
					comfortable with its UI as well). The second source of help
					was lecture recordings. Lecture recordings were a big help
					throughout almost all of issues I was having, it helped with
					many different aspects of the assignment. The third and 
					final source I used was of course the internet. Just like 
					with the videos from lecture I used this throughout my 
					entire assignment.
